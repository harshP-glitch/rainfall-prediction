 # 🌧️ Rainfall Prediction Model using LSTM (Deep Learning)

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project presents a **deep learning-based rainfall prediction model** using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network. It is designed to **predict future rainfall patterns** based on historical weather data. The system is capable of forecasting rainfall for the next day, next 7 days, and even extended periods like **6 months to 1 year**, based on user-defined input.

This model is ideal for sectors such as:
- **Agriculture**
- **Disaster Management**
- **Urban Planning**
- **Water Resource Management**
- **Weather Forecasting Applications**

## 🚀 Features

- 📈 **Multi-step Forecasting**: Predict rainfall for multiple days into the future using LSTM sequence learning.
- 👤 **User-Friendly Input Interface** (for app deployment): Accepts input such as "Next 1 day", "Next 6 months", or "1 year".
- 🔁 **Sliding Window Technique**: Learns patterns using past sequences and predicts upcoming rainfall amounts.
- 🧠 **LSTM Model**: Built using TensorFlow/Keras with optimized architecture for time-series data.
- 📊 **Interactive Visualization**: Graphical output of future rainfall trends for intuitive understanding.
- 🛠️ **Modular Code Design**: Easy to scale, upgrade, and integrate with platforms like Streamlit, Flask, or web dashboards.
